      <title>Seminar- Dr. Seyyed Ehsan Hashemi-Petroodi</title>
      <link>https://uoa-iai.github.io/post/seminar-seyyed/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 26 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://uoa-iai.github.io/post/seminar-seyyed/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We were honored to host Dr. Seyyed Ehsan Hashemi-Petroodi for a guest lecture at our department. Dr. Hashemi-Petroodi is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Operations Management and Information Systems. He received his Ph.D. in Industrial Engineering and Operations Research from IMT Atlantique, France, and has led key tasks in major European projects such as ASSISTANT. His research focuses on combinatorial and robust optimization, reconfigurable assembly line design, workforce and process planning, and decision support systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;display:flex; justify-content:center; gap:10px;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;1.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;KEDGE Slide 1&#34; style=&#34;width:45%;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;2.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;KEDGE Slide 2&#34; style=&#34;width:45%;&#34;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the talk, Dr. Hashemi-Petroodi introduced KEDGE Business School and its research activities, including the EU Horizon MODALSHIFT project on multimodal transport systems and dynamic decision-making. He then presented his recent work on robust design and reconfiguration planning of mixed-model assembly lines under product evolution and demand uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;display:flex; justify-content:center; gap:10px;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;3.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;KEDGE Slide 1&#34; style=&#34;width:45%;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;4.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;KEDGE Slide 2&#34; style=&#34;width:45%;&#34;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first study explored how to robustly react to product family evolution in production design and reconfiguration. A novel robust Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model combined with an adversarial approach was shown to significantly reduce long-term costs compared with classical periodic approaches. The second study addressed the robust re-balancing of assembly lines facing random product sequences, modeling worker movements and dynamic task re-allocation as a Markov Decision Process integrated with MILP. Computational experiments demonstrated the efficiency of the proposed models and the superiority of dynamic over fixed task assignments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;display:flex; justify-content:center; gap:10px;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;5.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;KEDGE Slide 1&#34; style=&#34;width:45%;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;6.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;KEDGE Slide 2&#34; style=&#34;width:45%;&#34;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The session concluded with an active discussion among Dr. Hashemi-Petroodi, Dr. Yuqian Lu, and students on the challenges of uncertainty in assembly systems and the potential of reinforcement learning for future human-robot collaborative environments.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Call for Paper - Embodied Intelligence Empowering Smart Manufacturing</title>
      <link>https://uoa-iai.github.io/post/embodied-intelligence/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 11 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Embodied Intelligence Empowering Smart Manufacturing
&lt;strong&gt;Submission deadline: 31 August 2025&lt;/strong&gt;
Embodied Intelligence (EI) is a key enabler of flexible and efficient manufacturing in smart manufacturing. EI enhances the perception, memory, cognition, reasoning, decision-making, planning, control, and iterative evolution capabilities within smart manufacturing systems. However, existing AI methods designed for specific tasks may lack adaptability and learning evolution capabilities needed to address personalization. The limited knowledge sharing and collaboration among independent AI models result hinders collective intelligence. AI methods that rely on fixed models and predefined rules are not easily adaptable to unpredictable scenarios in flexible, dynamic, and unstructured manufacturing environments. In addition, human-machine collaboration in smart manufacturing remains inefficient, and manufacturing equipment demands more intelligent collaborative control methods. The standalone equipment and information exchange in current smart manufacturing systems do not fully support the implementation of embodied intelligence technologies. To elevate the intelligence of smart manufacturing, this special issue aims at exploring technological advancements and applications of embodied intelligence-driven smart manufacturing. It will address key technical challenges in areas such as multimodal fusion, machine learning algorithms, human-computer interaction, and collaboration. These advancements are crucial to the progress of smart manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Special Issue Topics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The topics covered in this special issue include, but are not limited to, the following research areas and technologies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Human-machine interaction and collaboration based on embodied intelligence&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We are delighted to share that Ilango Kandasamy and Yuqian Lu just won a Best Paper Award at the recently concluded 51st International Conference on Computers and Industrial Engineering (CIE51), 9-11 December 2024, at UNSW Sydney, Australia, for his paper &amp;lsquo;Instructing Collaborative Robots using Large Language Models for Human-Robot Collaboration&amp;rsquo;. Ilango Kandasamy has recently completed his Master of Robotics &amp;amp; Automation Engineering programme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is the abstract of the paper:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The future of smart manufacturing hinges on robots enhancing performance and productivity, but the complex communication interface between humans and robots remains a challenge. Using natural language instructions to guide robots during collaboration will significantly improve human-robot interaction. Despite the efforts to improve the robot‚Äôs ability to interpret natural language instructions, progress has been limited due to the weak generalisation and adaptability of traditional robot programming methods. Pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) trained on huge volumes of text data excel in Natural Language processing tasks such as semantic parsing and automatic text generation. In this study, we explored using LLMs to comprehend the basic industrial assembly instructions in natural language and convert them into low-level tasks for robots to execute additional training. We used the assembly instructions from the HA-ViD dataset to evaluate the performance of GPT-3.5 model in semantic parsing of these instructions. The GPT-3.5 demonstrated excellent generalisation in converting previously unseen industrial assembly instructions by learning from prompts. Additionally, we explored the possibility of using Vision Language Models (VLM) for object detection tasks in a novel scenario by prompting them with text input to specify target objects to be detected in the image. Finally, we proposed an end-to-end system architecture to illustrate the integration of voice and LLMs, demonstrating the performance of GPT-3.5 in converting natural language instruction into low-level robot actions for industrial assembly tasks.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The manufacturing industry in Aotearoa New Zealand faces a longstanding productivity challenge due to the unsuitability of traditional automation methods for its high-mix-low-volume nature. To address this, we will develop ultra-flexible smooth human-robot collaboration technologies. These innovations will enable seamless interaction between humans and robots in dynamic manufacturing setups, particularly in product assembly, through advanced cognitive capabilities. Robots equipped with real-time human state sensing, reasoning, and adaptive behaviour planning will understand and respond to human physical and cognitive states, enhancing productivity. Multimodal human-robot communication interfaces will ensure accessibility and cultural relevance, including support for te reo MƒÅori.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team comprises experts in human sensing, robot control, human-machine interactions, and MƒÅori knowledge, ensuring a comprehensive approach. We will collaborate closely with stakeholders throughout the project, including government agencies, industry associations, end-users, consultants, and MƒÅori and Pacific communities. By co-designing the technology with key industry partners, we will ensure its effectiveness and commercial viability. Ultimately, the project seeks to revolutionise manufacturing automation in New Zealand and globally, leading to improved productivity, product quality, and economic benefits. The advanced robot control technologies will also have global applications and can be exported as high-value software packages. Importantly, the project incorporates Tikanga following MƒÅori data sovereignty principles and aims to support workplace well-being for MƒÅori and all New Zealanders, emphasising cultural sensitivity and inclusivity in technology development.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    Below is a repost of Dr. Yuqian Lu&amp;rsquo;s interview with National Science Challenge, SfTI. Original post at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sftichallenge.govt.nz/blending-cutting-edge-science-and-commercial-potential/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;https://www.sftichallenge.govt.nz/blending-cutting-edge-science-and-commercial-potential/&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many scientists, success is measured in the number of high-impact papers they publish. For others, it is about training the next generation of innovators. For some, the focus is on commercialisation ‚Äì translating their research into real-world products. Dr Yuqian Lu from the University of Auckland (UoA) is a scientist achieving all three, with the support of SfTI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently a Senior Lecturer in the Faculty of Engineering, Yuqian also leads the university‚Äôs Industrial AI Group.  There, he and his team work on everything from human-robot collaboration to next-generation communication for manufacturing systems. ‚ÄúWe really believe artificial intelligence and robotics can have a huge impact on industry,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúOur work is about transforming the workplace into a more efficient, enjoyable, and sustainable environment.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúWe really believe artificial intelligence and robotics can have a huge impact on industry,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúOur work is about transforming the workplace into a more efficient, enjoyable, and sustainable environment.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This ambitious vision has been developing ever since Yuqian moved to New Zealand to do his PhD in mechatronics at UoA. While working on his thesis, Yuqian found himself considering his next steps. ‚ÄúThe obvious choice was to go into a postdoc. But my research area was very industry-facing, and I wanted to make a long-term impact in those areas. I felt nervous that I had no real understanding of how industry works, or how they identify what‚Äôs important to them. So, I chose to start my career in industry.‚Äù He would end up spending three-and-a-half years away from the lab, working on manufacturing process automation and intelligent system R&amp;amp;D for NZ-based companies. In his most senior role, Yuqian acted as product owner for a series of new commercial software products at FRAMECAD Ltd. ‚ÄúIt was like a start-up experience within a big company,‚Äù he explains. ‚ÄúI did everything from leading the R&amp;amp;D, to developing the market strategy and pricing models.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

     &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That experience would stay with Yuqian, and since returning to academia in 2019, it has shaped the way he approaches research. ‚ÄúI always ask myself and my students, what‚Äôs the biggest impact we can have? Regardless of whether they‚Äôre doing a masters or a PhD, I want them to work on something that will ultimately be transformative to that specific industry. We consider the whole commercial pathway.‚Äù His entrepreneurial approach to science has attracted attention from funding bodies and commercial companies alike.&lt;/p&gt;

We consider the whole commercial pathway.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2021, Yuqian received a seed grant from SfTI. Titled ‚ÄòUltra-reliable time-sensitive industrial control in the cloud‚Äô, his project aims to combine three cutting-edge technologies ‚Äì automation, artificial intelligence, and 5G communication ‚Äì to improve robotic control in industrial settings. He‚Äôs collaborating with telecoms experts at Spark and Nokia, and computer scientists at Victoria University of Wellington, to make this a reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, industrial robots communicate via wired connections between a local controller and the robot body. This reduces the time it takes to transmit and receive data, ensuring that a robot arm does exactly what its instructed to, at precisely the right moment. However, if this communication could instead happen in the cloud wirelessly, it could offer incredible opportunities, as Yuqian explains. ‚ÄúImagine if one day, we could have the world‚Äôs top surgeon based in the US remotely operating on a patient in Auckland Hospital via robots. Or a fleet of industrial robots are centrally managed remotely‚Äù Our current 4G network doesn‚Äôt allow for sufficiently fast and reliable data exchange, so Yuqian is looking ahead to 5G. ‚ÄúThe critical piece of the SfTI research is to develop smart algorithms that can compensate for issues that may occur even during 5G data transmission? So that, from an application perspective, a robot can move smoothly, in a time-sensitive way.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joseph Wong, Innovation Lead of Spark New Zealand says, ‚ÄúWe are proud to work with Yuqian on this particular project. Spark‚Äôs goal is to help New Zealanders win big in a digital world, and Yuqian‚Äôs project certainly fits very well into that. The research is very valuable ‚Äì it basically opens up cloud-based robotics control to industry, and makes it more scalable. And hopefully with that, it‚Äôll become more cost-effective.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yuqian described the support he‚Äôs received from SfTI throughout this project as ‚Äú‚Ä¶really excellent. They want to encourage development of next generation technology, without losing the sight of how beneficial that tech can be to society. The funding means I can work on a project I love, and I get access to some great workshops and networking opportunities.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SfTI also supported Yuqian‚Äôs recent successful application for the prestigious KiwiNet Emerging Innovator Program. Our commercialisation manager, Enrico Tronchin says, ‚ÄúSfTI is really focussed on ensuring the maximum impact from our researchers‚Äô work is achieved in our final year. One way to do this is via partnerships with organisations like KiwiNet, which allow us to find pathways to impact for SfTI researchers that will outlive the Challenge.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Yuqian, being selected as an Emerging Innovator is an important step on his journey, ‚ÄúThis will allow me to take my SfTI research outcome to the next level. I‚Äôm really excited about this opportunity and am very grateful.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Groundbreaking Research in Manufacturing Quality Control from Karen Wang</title>
      <link>https://uoa-iai.github.io/post/rootcase-jms/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 23 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://uoa-iai.github.io/post/rootcase-jms/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In a significant advancement for the manufacturing industry, Karen Wang, a master&amp;rsquo;s student at the University of Auckland, has developed an innovative approach to root cause analysis of product defects. This breakthrough came as part of her one-year master&amp;rsquo;s study, conducted in collaboration with AspectPT Ltd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wang&amp;rsquo;s research introduces the product-wise Ensemble Bayesian Network (EBN), a robust and intelligent method for identifying the root causes of manufacturing defects. This novel approach combines Bayesian Networks with ensemble learning techniques, offering a more reliable and interpretable solution to a long-standing challenge in quality control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, co-authored with Chao Liu from Aston University and Yuqian Lu from the University of Auckland, demonstrates significant improvements in acquiring causal knowledge, identifying root causes with probabilities, and predicting quality risks in production. Tested with real-world data from the plastics industry, the EBN method shows promise for enhancing manufacturing quality and productivity across various sectors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This collaboration between academia and industry showcases the potential for student-led research to drive meaningful innovations in the manufacturing landscape. AspectPT Ltd&amp;rsquo;s involvement underscores the immediate practical applications of Wang&amp;rsquo;s work, bridging the gap between theoretical research and industry needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As manufacturers worldwide seek to optimize their processes and reduce defects, Wang&amp;rsquo;s contribution represents a timely and valuable tool in the pursuit of excellence in product quality.&lt;/p&gt;

However, if this communication could instead happen in the cloud wirelessly, it could offer incredible opportunities, as Yuqian explains. ‚ÄúImagine if one day, we could have the world‚Äôs top surgeon based in the US remotely operating on a patient in Auckland Hospital via robots. Or a fleet of industrial robots are centrally managed remotely‚Äù Our current 4G network doesn‚Äôt allow for sufficiently fast and reliable data exchange, so Yuqian is looking ahead to 5G. ‚ÄúThe critical piece of the SfTI research is to develop smart algorithms that can compensate for issues that may occur even during 5G data transmission? So that, from an application perspective, a robot can move smoothly, in a time-sensitive way.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A mobile manipulator to help workers on the factory floor</title>
      <link>https://uoa-iai.github.io/post/mobile-manipulator/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 24 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://uoa-iai.github.io/post/mobile-manipulator/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;What if you had a robot assistant that could help you use a screwdriver, pick things off a shelf, and carry things around a factory? It might not be something out of a science-fiction novel too much longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Yuqian Lu from the Department of Mechanical Engineering is creating a mobile robot that can do just that. The robot has built-in intelligence to navigate around people and obstacles, think and act autonomously. Lu wants to create a robot that can work alongside humans as part of a human-robot team to meet New Zealand‚Äôs industry needs better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditional automation techniques are efficient for creating standardised products at large volume: cars, phones, and more. But that doesn‚Äôt work for lots of New Zealand manufacturers. Many New Zealand manufacturers are smaller than their overseas counterparts and make highly customised products with manual or semi-automated manufacturing processes. ‚ÄúYou may be surprised to see the amount of manual and repetitive work in the factories of some of the most innovative high-tech companies‚Äù, Dr Lu says.&lt;/p&gt;

   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   &lt;figure  &gt;
     &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
       &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; srcset=&#34;
                  /post/mobile-manipulator/mobile_manipulator_hu8571d454dca6e406c99cc541fc63b1db_118177_8673882b91ed9e666f2e3491151b4d43.webp 400w,
                  /post/mobile-manipulator/mobile_manipulator_hu8571d454dca6e406c99cc541fc63b1db_118177_632b1671ed6a73f86f15fa3e6e2e65fe.webp 760w,
                  /post/mobile-manipulator/mobile_manipulator_hu8571d454dca6e406c99cc541fc63b1db_118177_1200x1200_fit_q80_h2_lanczos.webp 1200w&#34;
                  src=&#34;https://uoa-iai.github.io/post/mobile-manipulator/mobile_manipulator_hu8571d454dca6e406c99cc541fc63b1db_118177_8673882b91ed9e666f2e3491151b4d43.webp&#34;
                  width=&#34;760&#34;

                  loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
     &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs generally not technically or commercially viable for these manufacturers to invest in expensive standardised automation technologies. So, Dr Lu, with his colleagues from the Laboratory of Industry 4.0 Smart Manufacturing Lab at the Faculty of Engineering, proposed a solution. What if they built a flexible and intelligent robot that could help with many different jobs and move from project to project?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this reason, an autonomous mobile robot allows manufacturers an unprecedented level of flexibility. It can be integrated with already-existing manufacturing cells to co-manipulate manual work. New Zealand small manufacturers can introduce flexible robots gradually, test them out, and take their own steps towards automating their facilities. Dr Lu is also working on teaching his robots to autonomously learn new tasks in a factory to better support human operators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Lu‚Äôs goal is that the mobile robot will soon work as an assistant or as part of a team with human workers. He envisions it helping screw things in and working safely around human operators to free them of tedious and repetitive work, among other tasks. ‚ÄúWe want to create a human-robot collaboration,‚Äù Dr Lu said.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>2021 Science for Technological Innovation National Science Challenge (SfTI) Grant</title>
      <link>https://uoa-iai.github.io/post/sfti/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 19 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://uoa-iai.github.io/post/sfti/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Industrial AI Team @ UOA was awarded the prestigious SfTI seed grant over two years to advance time-sensitive industrial control technologies in 5G environment, in collaboration with Victoria University of Wellington, Spark New Zealand and Nokia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Project Title: Ultra-reliable time-sensitive industrial control in the cloud&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public Statement: As the momentum of 5G builds, a range of applications will be developed. These include real-time cloud-controlled industrial systems and self-driving vehicles. The need is for 5G technology to provide robust and time-sensitive data transmission over wide area networks (WANs). This is to ensure the systems and vehicles can interact simultaneously without, for example, arriving out of order or colliding. This project, led by University of Auckland researchers, aims to design a data communication scheduling algorithm and supporting streaming technologies. This will enable time-sensitive transmission of control data for multiple devices over WANs.&lt;/p&gt;
