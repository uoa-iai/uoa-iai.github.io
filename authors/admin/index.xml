      <title>Yuqian Lu on 1News about AI, robots and 5G</title>
      <link>https://uoa-iai.github.io/post/onenews-2023/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 16 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://uoa-iai.github.io/post/onenews-2023/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, Dr. Yuqian Lu was interviewed by 1News reporter, Logan Church about how a 5G-enabled environment can accelerate productivity in conjunction with AI and robotics, and how 5G technology could possibly enable real-time robot control from the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;video src=&#34;1news%20interview%20clip.mp4&#34; controls=&#34;yes&#34;&gt;&lt;/video&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2021, Yuqian received a seed grant from SfTI National Science Challenge. Titled ‘Ultra-reliable time-sensitive industrial control in the cloud’, his project aims to combine three cutting-edge technologies – automation, artificial intelligence, and 5G communication – to improve robotic control in industrial settings. And he’s collaborating with telecoms experts at Spark and Nokia, and computer scientists at Victoria University of Wellington to make this a reality.
Today, the communication networks that connect industrial robots are via wired connections between a local controller and the robot body. This reduces the time it takes to transmit and receive data, ensuring that a robot arm does exactly what its instructed to, at precisely the right moment. However, if this communication could instead happen in the cloud wirelessly, it could offer incredible opportunities, as Yuqian explains. “Imagine if one day, we could have the world’s top surgeon based in the US remotely operating on a patient in Auckland Hospital via robots. Or a fleet of industrial robots are centrally managed remotely” Our current 4G network doesn’t allow for sufficiently fast and reliable data exchange, so Yuqian is looking ahead to 5G. “The critical piece of the SfTI research is to develop smart algorithms that can compensate for issues that may occur even during 5G data transmission? So that, from an application perspective, a robot can move smoothly, in a time-sensitive way.”&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A mobile manipulator to help workers on the factory floor</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What if you had a robot assistant that could help you use a screwdriver, pick things off a shelf, and carry things around a factory? It might not be something out of a science-fiction novel too much longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Yuqian Lu from the Department of Mechanical Engineering is creating a mobile robot that can do just that. The robot has built-in intelligence to navigate around people and obstacles, think and act autonomously. Lu wants to create a robot that can work alongside humans as part of a human-robot team to meet New Zealand’s industry needs better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditional automation techniques are efficient for creating standardised products at large volume: cars, phones, and more. But that doesn’t work for lots of New Zealand manufacturers. Many New Zealand manufacturers are smaller than their overseas counterparts and make highly customised products with manual or semi-automated manufacturing processes. “You may be surprised to see the amount of manual and repetitive work in the factories of some of the most innovative high-tech companies”, Dr Lu says.&lt;/p&gt;

                  src=&#34;https://uoa-iai.github.io/post/mobile-manipulator/mobile_manipulator_hu8571d454dca6e406c99cc541fc63b1db_118177_8673882b91ed9e666f2e3491151b4d43.webp&#34;

                  loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
     &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s generally not technically or commercially viable for these manufacturers to invest in expensive standardised automation technologies. So, Dr Lu, with his colleagues from the Laboratory of Industry 4.0 Smart Manufacturing Lab at the Faculty of Engineering, proposed a solution. What if they built a flexible and intelligent robot that could help with many different jobs and move from project to project?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this reason, an autonomous mobile robot allows manufacturers an unprecedented level of flexibility. It can be integrated with already-existing manufacturing cells to co-manipulate manual work. New Zealand small manufacturers can introduce flexible robots gradually, test them out, and take their own steps towards automating their facilities. Dr Lu is also working on teaching his robots to autonomously learn new tasks in a factory to better support human operators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Lu’s goal is that the mobile robot will soon work as an assistant or as part of a team with human workers. He envisions it helping screw things in and working safely around human operators to free them of tedious and repetitive work, among other tasks. “We want to create a human-robot collaboration,” Dr Lu said.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Industrial AI Team @ UOA was awarded the prestigious SfTI seed grant over two years to advance time-sensitive industrial control technologies in 5G environment, in collaboration with Victoria University of Wellington, Spark New Zealand and Nokia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Project Title: Ultra-reliable time-sensitive industrial control in the cloud&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public Statement: As the momentum of 5G builds, a range of applications will be developed. These include real-time cloud-controlled industrial systems and self-driving vehicles. The need is for 5G technology to provide robust and time-sensitive data transmission over wide area networks (WANs). This is to ensure the systems and vehicles can interact simultaneously without, for example, arriving out of order or colliding. This project, led by University of Auckland researchers, aims to design a data communication scheduling algorithm and supporting streaming technologies. This will enable time-sensitive transmission of control data for multiple devices over WANs.&lt;/p&gt;
