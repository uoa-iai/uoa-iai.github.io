 abstract = {Digital Twin, as an integral enabling technology that integrates multi-physics and multi-scale digital models of physical assets, is critical for achieving interaction and integration between the physical space and virtual world. Though some preliminary research work has proved the potential of Digital Twin to enable efficient smart manufacturing, a limitation to the implementation of Digital Twin is the lack of a reference model for Digital Twin. Targeting at this knowledge gap, the research work in this paper proposes a Digital Twin reference model, with a focus on the enabling technologies to construct a Digital Twin.
