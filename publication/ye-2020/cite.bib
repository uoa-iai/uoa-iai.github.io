 abstract = {Manufacturers use cloud manufacturing platforms to offer their services. The literature has suggested a semantic web-based cloud manufacturing framework, in which engineering knowledge is modeled using structured syntax. Translating engineering rules to semantic rules by human is a painstaking task and prone to mistakes. We present a scheme that treats converting engineering knowledge into semantic rules as a machine translation task and uses neural machine translation techniques to carry out the conversion.
