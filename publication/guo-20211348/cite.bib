 abstract = {Automatic process decision-making is a key module in intelligent process design(IPD), which determines the intelligence degree of IPD and affects the quality of product design. The traditional process decision-making method fails to solve the problem of knowledge expression, especially the integration of enterprise manufacturing resources and process knowledge. What’s more, heterogeneous knowledge also leads to the application of traditional knowledge mainly in keyword retrieval. So the process reasoning is mainly applied to the feature level, but the reasoning ability for the part level is weak. To overcome the above problems, the Knowledge Graph(KG) is introduced into the automatic machining process decision-making system. Firstly, a three-level information model is built to reorganize part information, process knowledge, and equipment resources based on KG. Secondly, the process reasoning framework based on KG is established, which is composed of process knowledge graph(PKG) information and process reasoning algorithm. Thirdly, to integrate process reasoning based on PKG, a hybrid reasoning algorithm based on semantic analysis(SA) and attributes weighting(AW) is built, which solved the problem of heterogeneity among process knowledge when making decisions. Finally, a prototype system was developed, and the aero-engine cone gear axis was tested to verify the effectiveness of the proposed system. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},
