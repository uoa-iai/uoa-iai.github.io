 abstract = {Cloud manufacturing has been recognised as a transformative manufacturing paradigm to enable rapid production of highly customised products in a networked environment, through on-demand consumption of cloud-based manufacturing services. The fundamental issue of on-demand manufacturing service provision is service composition, where distributed manufacturing resources are mapped to personalised service requests. This paper examines knowledge-based service composition and adaptive resource planning in a cloud manufacturing environment. The intention is to develop an integrated networked environment, allowing fast resource allocation for a given service request, subject to governance policies, resource access policies, resource availability information and etcetera. The research challenge in this is to explore a feasible service composition method that facilitates easy mapping between service requests and manufacturing resources based on restrictive rule sets in the cloud and availability information about a resource. The research work in this paper analyses the relevant research challenges, proposes a practical approach and implements the solution in the form of a web-based system. The proposed system utilises distributed knowledge for intelligent service composition and adaptive resource planning. A case study is also presented to validate the performance of the proposed approach. Â© 2016 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers},
