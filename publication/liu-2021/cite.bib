 abstract = {Metal products are susceptible to factors such as cutting force, clamping force and heat in the machining process, resulting in product quality problems, such as geometric deformation and surface defects. The real-time observation and control of product quality are integral to optimizing machining process. Digital twin technologies can be used to monitor and control the quality of products via multi-scale based quality analysis. However, previous research on digital twin lacks a fine-grained expression and generation method for product multi-scale quality, making it impossible to carry out an in-depth analysis of product quality. Aiming at addressing this challenge, we study the multi-scale evolution mechanism of the digital twin model and explore the knowledge generation method of the digital twin data. The proposed method constructed the digital twin quality knowledge model from the macro, meso, and micro levels by utilizing the data of the digital twin mimic model. These multi-scale quality knowledge models can express product quality in a fine-grained way and provide data support for digital twin-based decision-making. Finally, we tested the method in monitoring and controlling the machining quality of an air rudder to verify the feasibility of the proposed method. Â© 2021},
