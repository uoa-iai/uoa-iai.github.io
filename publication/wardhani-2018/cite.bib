 abstract = {Digital twin has attracted a myriad of interest. Today, the term is progressively adopted in manufacturing. Even though it is a recent trend, the concept originated from the study of product lifecycle management and was developed in aerospace. Since then, the concept has been viewed from different perspectives. Covering conference and journal articles published in digital twin manufacturing, this paper is aimed to provide a comprehensive review of digital twin in manufacturing which covers the history of the concept of digital twin, presents a discussion of different perspectives on digital twin and analyses the objectives and virtual resources of digital twin in manufacturing. Identification of digital twin application in manufacturing stage has been conducted to consider other potential possibilities of development in the near future. © 2018, Curran Associates Inc.
