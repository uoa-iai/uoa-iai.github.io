 abstract = {Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are an integral element of Industry 4.0, and these systems are said to have become gradually more intelligent throughout the years. Moreover, as technologies such as Artificial Intelligence and Internet of Things evolve, the suspicion arises on whether machines and humans could cohesively share control in the system. Despite efforts in the literature regarding the architecture and the implementation of CPS and Human CyberPhysical Systems (HCPS), more work needs to be done to highlight the similarities and strengths between people and machines. In this work, we take on the challenge to show that comparison from a human-skill perspective. This analysis highlights some of the human capabilities that have been moved to technologies. It also presents an updated list of human-machine capability differences. Besides, it identifies the human elements involved in HCPS as well as the skills included and required while working with HCPS. Â© 2020 IEEE.},
