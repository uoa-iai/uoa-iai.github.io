 abstract = {In the context of an increasingly automated and personalized manufacturing mode, efficient assembly sequence planning (ASP) has emerged as a critical factor for enhancing production efficiency, ensuring product quality, and satisfying diverse market demands. To address this need, our study first transforms the assembly topology and process into a weighted precedence graph, wherein parts represent nodes, and the assembly interconnections between parts constitute weighted edges. Then, we formulate the quantitative models of semantic knowledge, encompassing three facets: assembly direction changes, assembly stability, and part assembly interference, and thus constructs a heuristic function. We propose a novel dynamic graph learning algorithm, i.e., assembly-oriented graph attention sequence (A-GASeq), utilizing the heuristic information as edge weights of the assembly graph structure to incrementally direct the search towards optimal sequences. The performance of A-GASeq is first evaluated utilizing three key metrics: area under the receiver operation characteristic curve (AUC), precision score, and time consumption. The results reveal the superiority of our model over competing state-of-the-art graph learning models using a real-world dataset. Concurrently, we apply the algorithm to actual industrial products of diverse complexity, thereby demonstrating its broad utility across different complex products and its potential for addressing complex assembly sequence planning problems in the field of smart manufacturing.
