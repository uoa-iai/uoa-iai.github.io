 abstract = {Industrial tabular information extraction and its semantic fusion with text (ITIESF) is of great significance in converting and fusing industrial unstructured data into structured knowledge to guide cognitive intelligence analysis in the manufacturing industry. A novel end-to-end ITIESF approach is proposed to integrate tabular information and construct a tabular information-oriented causality event evolutionary knowledge graph (TCEEKG). Specifically, an end-to-end joint learning strategy is presented to mine the semantic information in tables. The definition and modeling method of the intrinsic relationships between tables with their rows and columns in engineering documents are provided to model the tabular information. Due to this, an end-to-end joint entity relationship extraction method for textual and tabular information from engineering documents is proposed to construct text-based knowledge graphs (KG) and tabular information-based causality event evolutionary graphs (CEEG). Then, a novel NSGCN (neighborhoods sample graph convolution network)-based entity alignment is proposed to fuse the cross-knowledge graphs into a unified knowledge base. Furthermore, a translation-based graph structure-driven Q&A (question and answer) approach is designed to respond to cause analysis and problem tracing. Our models can be easily integrated into a prototype system to provide a joint information processing and cognitive analysis. Finally, the approach is evaluated by employing the aerospace machining documents to illustrate that the TCEEKG can considerably help workers strengthen their skills in the cause-and-effect analysis of machining quality issues from a global perspective.
