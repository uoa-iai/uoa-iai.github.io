 abstract = {The rapid transformation of production lines into a new design scheme is the key to improving the market competitiveness of enterprises. The production line is a complex manufacturing system with a complex structure. There are multidisciplinary correlation networks between different design dimensions, such as causality, mapping, and transfer. Clarifying these correlative relations is the key to the design of production line correlation. In this paper, a descriptive system is built for the production line configuration model, the motion model, the control model, and the optimization model, and the design content of production lines is clarified. A design framework of production line correlation based on the digital twin technology is proposed, and an optimization system of design schemes is built in the form of hierarchical iteration. Polychromatic sets are used to identify the relationship between different dimensions. The high-fidelity simulation ability of the digital twin technology is taken advantage of to verify the proposed four-in-one variant design method in the mobile phone welding assembly line.
