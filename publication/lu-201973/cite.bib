 abstract = {Manufacturing is becoming smart with capabilities of self-awareness, autonomous decision-making, and adaptive excitation and collaboration. Standardization is a crucial enabler for achieving the required intelligence for smart manufacturing. Though a large number of efforts have been made to the development of manufacturing standards, there is still a significant research gap to be fulfilled. This paper reviews the landscape of existing standards in the context of smart manufacturing and offers guidance on the selection of the standards for different smart manufacturing applications.
