 abstract = {For visual SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping) systems in dynamic environments, the harmfulness of dynamic objects in the environment to the classic visual SLAM system is analyzed firstly, and the existing dynamic visual SLAM systems are divided into two categories according to whether the system is based on camera ego-motion or not. Then, the current research status of visual SLAM in dynamic environment is summarized and analyzed. Finally, the processing method and future trend of visual SLAM in dynamic environment are discussed and prospected. © 2021, Science Press. All right reserved.},
