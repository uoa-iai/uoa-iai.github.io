 abstract = {With the intent to further increase production efficiency, which we get by implementing human-robot collaboration, there is a need to make production human-centric. Similarly, evolving robots, such as unmanned ground and aerial vehicles, should be also designed according to these human-centric principles. This paper presents the industry's current and potential unmanned ground and aerial vehicle applications. Subsequently, applications where both ground and aerial vehicles are used in a single application are observed. The paper focuses on designing a human-centric conceptual frame-work to implement collaboration aspects into these applications involving unmanned ground and aerial vehicles. Lastly, it presents a proof of concept application introducing cooperation and collaboration of human, ground, and aerial vehicles. Â© 2023 IEEE.},
