 abstract = {Cloud manufacturing represents a service-oriented manufacturing paradigm that allows ubiquitous and on-demand access to various customisable manufacturing services in the cloud. While a vast amount of research in cloud manufacturing has focused on high-level decision-making tasks, such as service composition and scheduling, the link between field-level manufacturing data and the cloud manufacturing platform has not been well established. Efficient data acquisition, communication, storage, query, and analysis of field-level manufacturing equipment remain a significant challenge that hinders the development of cloud manufacturing systems. Therefore, this paper investigates the implementation of the emerging Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) technologies in a cloud manufacturing system to address this challenge. We propose a service-oriented plug-and-play (PnP) IIoT gateway solution based on a generic system architecture of IIoT-supported cloud manufacturing system. Service-oriented data schemas for manufacturing equipment are developed to capture just-enough information about field-level manufacturing equipment and allow efficient data storage and query in a cloud time-series database (TSDB). We tested the feasibility and advantages of the proposed approach via the practical implementation of the IIoT gateways on a 3D printer and a machine tool. Our research suggests that purposely developed service-oriented data schemas that capture the essential information for high-level cloud manufacturing decision-making via PnP IIoT technologies are a good solution for connecting field-level manufacturing equipment to a cloud manufacturing platform.
