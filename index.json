Manufacturers aspire to a shift towards mass personalization – a paradigm that produces personalized products at mass efficiency. In mass personalization, traditional manufacturing automation technologies designed for mass customization, such as product family architecture, reconfiguration manufacturing systems and delayed differentiation, will fail if not adapt as batch size becomes one and manufacturing is dynamically driven by unique customer needs. Hence, smart manufacturing system was devised to represent a new generation of manufacturing system that can dynamically configure the manufacturing processes and systems to carry out optimized production of unique products based on near real-time environment sensing, humanoid reasoning and reconfiguration of system models. At the core, smart manufacturing systems need perceptive and decisive capabilities, leading to dynamic self-organizing behaviors. With advanced cognitive capabilities, manufacturing equipment, systems, and factories can self-sense, self-communicate, self-reason, and self-configure to prevent potential critical issues, optimize operations, and enhance the overall integration of machines, humans, and digital supply networks.\nPublications\nDazzle Johnson, G.

It might not be something out of a science-fiction novel too much longer.\nDr Yuqian Lu from the Department of Mechanical Engineering is creating a mobile robot that can do just that. The robot has built-in intelligence to navigate around people and obstacles, think and act autonomously. Lu wants to create a robot that can work alongside humans as part of a human-robot team to meet New Zealand’s industry needs better.\nTraditional automation techniques are efficient for creating standardised products at large volume: cars, phones, and more. But that doesn’t work for lots of New Zealand manufacturers. Many New Zealand manufacturers are smaller than their overseas counterparts and make highly customised products with manual or semi-automated manufacturing processes. “You may be surprised to see the amount of manual and repetitive work in the factories of some of the most innovative high-tech companies”, Dr Lu says.\nIt’s generally not technically or commercially viable for these manufacturers to invest in expensive standardised automation technologies. So, Dr Lu, with his colleagues from the Laboratory of Industry 4.0 Smart Manufacturing Lab at the Faculty of Engineering, proposed a solution. What if they built a flexible and intelligent robot that could help with many different jobs and move from project to project?\nFor this reason, an autonomous mobile robot allows manufacturers an unprecedented level of flexibility. It can be integrated with already-existing manufacturing cells to co-manipulate manual work. New Zealand small manufacturers can introduce flexible robots gradually, test them out, and take their own steps towards automating their facilities. Dr Lu is also working on teaching his robots to autonomously learn new tasks in a factory to better support human operators.\nDr Lu’s goal is that the mobile robot will soon work as an assistant or as part of a team with human workers. He envisions it helping screw things in and working safely around human operators to free them of tedious and repetitive work, among other tasks. “We want to create a human-robot collaboration,” Dr Lu said.\n","date":1648080000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1648080000,"objectID":"5c8fc5ce67ddaab3b2ead64af689c655","permalink":"https://uoa-iai.github.io/post/mobile-manipulator/","publishdate":"2022-03-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/mobile-manipulator/","section":"post","summary":"Interview by University of Auckland on our lastest mobile manipulator development.","tags":["robot","computer vision"],"title":"A mobile manipulator to help workers on the factory floor","type":"post"},{"authors":["Industrial AI Group"],"categories":["Publication","Award"],"content":"The Best Paper is awarded each year to the RCIM paper published in the past seven-year with the highest number of citations measured in Scopus over the past five years.

Due to the severe arc and fume interference in the welding area and limited computational resources at the welding edge nodes, it becomes a challenge to mine the most discriminative feature contained in welding images by using a lightweight model. In this paper, we propose an improved three-dimensional convolutional neural network (3DCNN) with separable structure and multi-dimensional attention (3DSMDA-Net) for WSR. The proposed 3DSMDA-Net uses 3DCNN to adaptively extract abstract spatiotemporal features in a welding process and then leverages such time sequence information to improve the recognition accuracy of WSR. In addition, we decompose the classical 3D convolution into depthwise convolution and pointwise convolution to produce a lightweight model. A multi-dimensional attention mechanism is further proposed to compensate for the loss of accuracy caused by the separation operation. The results of experiments reveal that the proposed method reduces the model size to 1/7 of the classical 3DCNN without sacrificing accuracy. The comparison experiment results have indicated that the accuracy of the proposed method is more accurate and noise-resistant than that of the conventional model. © 2021 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers","tags":[],"title":"3DSMDA-Net: An improved 3DCNN with separable structure and multi-dimensional attention for welding status recognition","type":"publication"},{"authors":["R.

Inappropriate collaborative behaviors will result in a poor perceptual experience for human operators (e.g., robots starting action too early or too late). To address this issue, a fusion-based spiking neural networks (FSNNs) approach for collaboration request prediction is proposed, aiming to find the right collaboration timing for robots in HRC assembly system and to minimize human aversion without affecting human operation behaviors. By encoding human behavior, product state and robot pose into spiking signals that can be processed by FSNNs, the spatio-temporal coupling relationship between those three aspects can be comprehensively analyzed, and to solve the appropriate timing of robot participation in collaboration. Finally, demonstrative experiments are carried out on the HRC assembly of generator end caps in the lab environment.

At the same time, the models have poor generality and portability. In order to solve above problems, a general fault diagnosis framework (GFDF) is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the collected signals, whether vibration signals or acoustic signals, are directly converted into two-dimensional gray images; secondly, the FAST-Enhanced-Unoriented-SIFT (FEUS) feature extraction algorithm proposed in this paper is used to extract feature vectors; then, the feature vectors are encoded by using the bag-of-words (BoW) model to obtain the basic words and codebook vectors; finally, the fault diagnosis is completed by calculating the distance between the description vector of the signal to be diagnosed and the codebook vectors. GFDF's main feature lies in the evitable frequency domain transformation and noise reduction, which makes GFDF insensitive to signal type and has high diagnostic efficiency. The experimental results show that GFDF has high diagnostic accuracy and stability for acoustic signals and vibration signals of rolling bearing and planetary gear at different rotating speeds, which proves that GFDF has generality and portability and is potential for the application in other scenes. Comparative experiments show that GFDF outperforms the representative traditional classification methods and deep learning models in diagnostic accuracy and stability. In addition, GFDF is applied to the fault diagnosis of the acoustic signals collected in motion to simulate the working state of inspection robots, and the ideal diagnostic result is also achieved.

However, traditional process knowledge base construction is non-automated, time consuming and requires much manual work, which is not sufficient to meet the demands of the modern manufacturing mode. Moreover, the knowledge base often adopts a single knowledge representation, and this may lead to ambiguity in the meaning of some knowledge, which will affect the quality of the process knowledge base. To overcome the above problems, an automatic construction framework for the process knowledge base in the field of machining based on knowledge graph (KG) is introduced. First, the knowledge is classified and annotated based on the function-behavior-states (FBS) design method. Second, a knowledge extraction framework based on BERT-BiLSTM-CRF is established to perform the automatic knowledge extraction of process text. Third, a knowledge representation method based on fuzzy comprehensive evaluation is established, forming three types of knowledge representation with the KG as the main, production rules and two-dimensional data linked list as a supplement. In addition, to overcome the redundancy in the knowledge fusion stage, a hybrid algorithm based on an improved edit distance and attribute weighting is built. Finally, a prototype system is developed, and quality analysis is carried out.

Nowadays, many SMEs are embarking on a digital transformation journey by embracing and deploying the Fourth Industrial Revolution (a.k.a. Industry 4.0) technologies with a vision of the “Factory of the Future”. Factory of the future aims to enhance production by making improvements in three dimensions: plant structure, plant digitization, and plant processes, which cut across many key function areas of Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES) such as management of product definitions, resource scheduling, order execution and dispatch, production analysis, product quality, and materials track and trace. The technological shift with the Factory of the Future, e.g., the adoption of information, communication, and networking technologies in the form of the cyber-physical production system (CPPS) in order to manage interoperability at the factory's functional levels in real-time, demands a fresh look at the functional aspects of MES as well as the interplays between MES and an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system and a process control system (e.g., SCADA). The Factory of the Future may lead to hierarchical changes in MES byways of redesigning the value chain for dynamic production and mass personalization scenarios. Deployment of the responsive and adaptive value chain in MES is still state-of-art-issue. The authors will address dynamic interoperability between modular functionalities for end-to-end integration and consider microservices scenarios to form a service-oriented architecture that supports the part of MES in the responsive and adaptive industrial value chain. Primary modules of the manufacturing execution system have been identified from ISA-95 standards and demonstration of end-to-end integration via OPC-UA server/client and PubSub mechanism contributing to the execution of business and manufacturing functions. Each element or activity runs in its own process and provides a microservice; each microservice communicate with other services and form a service-oriented architecture for MES. Finally, a universal framework solution has been proposed for dynamic interoperability, which intends to upgrade the value chain and networking of a conventional industry towards a factory of the future. © 2022 The Authors.

Traditional heuristic and meta-heuristic scheduling methods cannot achieve satisfactory results and have limited application to static environments. Recent Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches that consider dynamic FJSP, lack flexibility and autonomy as they use a single-agent centralised model, assuming global observability. As such, we propose a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) system for scheduling dynamically arriving assembly jobs in a robot assembly cell. We applied a Double DQN-based algorithm and proposed a generalised observation, action and reward design for the dynamic FJSP setting. Using a centralised training phase, each agent (i.e., robot) in the assembly cell executes decentralised scheduling decisions based on local observations. Our solution demonstrated improved performance against rule-based heuristic methods, for optimising makespan.

However, there is a lack of shared understanding of the essence of human-centric manufacturing, though significant research efforts exist in enhancing the physical and cognitive wellbeing of operators. Therefore, this position paper presents our arguments on the concept, needs, reference model, enabling technologies and system frameworks of human-centric manufacturing, providing a relatable vision and research agenda for future work in human-centric manufacturing systems. We believe human-centric manufacturing should ultimately address human needs defined in an Industrial Human Needs Pyramid – from basic needs of safety and health to the highest level of esteem and self-actualization. In parallel, human-machine relationships will change following a 5C evolution map – from current Coexistence, Cooperation and Collaboration to future Compassion and Coevolution. As such, human-centric manufacturing systems need to have bi-directional empathy, proactive communication and collaborative intelligence for establishing trustworthy human-machine coevolution relationships, thereby leading to high-performance human-machine teams.

While a vast amount of research in cloud manufacturing has focused on high-level decision-making tasks, such as service composition and scheduling, the link between field-level manufacturing data and the cloud manufacturing platform has not been well established. Efficient data acquisition, communication, storage, query, and analysis of field-level manufacturing equipment remain a significant challenge that hinders the development of cloud manufacturing systems. Therefore, this paper investigates the implementation of the emerging Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) technologies in a cloud manufacturing system to address this challenge. We propose a service-oriented plug-and-play (PnP) IIoT gateway solution based on a generic system architecture of IIoT-supported cloud manufacturing system. Service-oriented data schemas for manufacturing equipment are developed to capture just-enough information about field-level manufacturing equipment and allow efficient data storage and query in a cloud time-series database (TSDB). We tested the feasibility and advantages of the proposed approach via the practical implementation of the IIoT gateways on a 3D printer and a machine tool.

Currently, the data generated from the manufacturing industry are rapidly expanding. Such data are multi-source, heterogeneous and multi-scale. Transforming the data into knowledge to optimize the allocation between personalized orders and manufacturing resources is an effective strategy to improve the cognitive intelligent production level of enterprises. However, the manufacturing processes in resource allocation is diversity. There are many rules and constraints among the data. And the relationship among data is more complicated. There lacks a unified approach to information modeling and industrial knowledge generation from mining semantic information from massive manufacturing data. The research challenge is how to fully integrate the complex data of workshop resources and mine the implicit semantic information to form a viable knowledge-driven resource allocation optimization method. Such method can then efficiently provide the relevant engineering information needed for resource allocation. This research presented a unified knowledge graph-driven production resource allocation approach, allowing fast resource allocation decision-making for given order inserting tasks, subject to the resource machining information and the device evaluation strategy. The workshop resource knowledge graph (WRKG) model was presented to integrate the engineering semantic information in the machining workshop. A distributed knowledge representation learning algorithm was developed to mine the implicit resource information for updating the WRKG in real-time.

The framework utilizes a fatigue index profile that defines the fatigue development trend of an individuals' target muscle group and alongside the force-generating capacity of the muscle group under the dynamic target operations. By inducing fatigue buildup through the dynamic operations, impact the force-generating capacity, and therefore, the localized muscle fatigue can be determined through the isometric contraction phase. Results indicate that analyzing isometric contractions during complex, dynamic operations can provide a reliable fatigue impact estimation. Furthermore, this method maximizes signal uniformity by leveraging the isometric contraction's static nature while centering the fatigue buildup on the dynamic target operations. Although the proposed method was trialed using a dynamic vertical handling operation, the framework can determine the fatigue impact of more complex manufacturing operations with minimal deviation to the presented methods. © 2021 IEEE.","tags":[],"title":"Isometric-Based Approach for Detecting Localized Muscular Fatigue during Complex Dynamic Manufacturing Operations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["S.

This shift from push-type mass customization to pull-type mass personalization will pose critical operational challenges to manufacturing businesses, with complexities ranging from effective requirements elicitation to design, manufacturing, commissioning and after-sales support. Aiming at addressing these challenges, a feasible operational framework for enabling efficient manufacturing automation for mass personalization is proposed in this paper. A key element of this operational framework is the Digital Thread, which streamlines information flow associated with design, manufacturing, maintenance and servicing of a personalized product, each of which are represented as Digital Twins. An As-Designed Digital Twin is created from the beginning of the product co-design process, which then evolves into the subsequent design and manufacturing process and systems resulting in As-Designed Digital Twin evolving to As-Planned Digital Twin and then to As-Built Digital Twin. The personalized product, after it's commissioning and installation constitutes the As-Maintained Digital Twin of the product, which stores product data related to field performance. The data exchange and communications between these Digital Twins that reside in the various departments of the organization and the management systems create a seamless Digital Thread, capturing the lifecycle information of each personalized product. Personalized product is proposed to be developed through a self-organizing shopfloor, working on a multi-agent mechanism and controlled by a central agent control algorithm, which can coordinate and provide individualized process plans. The Digital Twins, interlinked by a Digital Thread and realized by a self-organizing shopfloor, thus result in increased level of automated control in engineering and manufacturing. To validate the feasibility of this proposed framework, we tested the information flow in the Digital Thread with a case study in the construction industry.

However, there are some crucial problems affecting finishing efficiency and quality, e.g. use of hard-to-machine material at the assembly interface, manual interventions and process diversity in finish machining, difficulties in the alignment of the large component, as well as errors between the as-built and as-designed status of the large component. These problems significantly enhance the uncertainty in finish machining on a shop floor. To solve these problems, this paper proposes an approach of adaptive process planning and execution, i.e., IEC 61499 Function Block (FB) based Closed-Loop Adaptive Machining (CLAM). Thus, the adaptive alignment of the large component is achieved, which can guarantee the correct location between the assembly interface and the cutting tool. As well as the on-line CLAM of the assembly interface is also realized to improve the machining efficiency and quality. As a result, a FB based CLAM system for the assembly interfaces is established, which contains a CAD system, a FB enabled High-Level Controller (HLC), and several Low-Level Controllers (LLCs), as well as a mechanical system. The most notable is that the related FBs are designed to plan and execute the finishing process. Finally, the proposed method and system are validated by a large component from a real aviation industry, i.e., a vertical tail of a passenger aircraft.

To gain an improved understanding of the trend and trajectory of research on robotics application for on-site building construction, this paper provides a systematic review of 52 articles identified through the PRISMA protocol and meta-analysis. The results show that robotic technologies for on-site construction is a growing application field, where additive manufacturing (AM), automated installation system, automated robotic assembly system, autonomous robotic assembly, and robotic bricklaying seem to be most studied and have a potential to influence the development of robotics research in building construction. While most research discussed single construction activities related to vertical reinforced concrete (RC) elements, masonry walls, steel beams, curtain walls, gypsum boards, and floor tiles, only a few papers proposed an integrated robotized construction site. It is suggested that the building construction industry and research organizations could benefit from the current product and work processes that can be improved by taking some measures through innovative construction materials, improved robotics hardware, and more advanced engineering design to streamline construction workflows to achieve a complete on-site robotic system. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","tags":[],"title":"Robotic technologies for on-site building construction: A systematic review","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yuqian Lu","M.R.

The new decentralized manufacturing automation paradigm features ubiquitous communication and interoperable interactions between machines. However, peer-to-peer (P2P) interoperable communications at the semantic level between industrial machines is a challenge. To address this challenge, we introduce a concept of Semantic-aware Cyber-Physical Systems (SCPSs) based on which manufacturing devices can establish semantic M2M communications. In this work, we propose a generic system architecture of SCPS and its enabling technologies. Our proposed system architecture adds a semantic layer and a communication layer to the conventional cyber-physical system (CPS) in order to maximize compatibility with the diverse CPS implementation architecture. With Semantic Web technologies as the backbone of the semantic layer, SCPSs can exchange semantic messages with maximum interoperability following the same understanding of the manufacturing context. A pilot implementation of the presented work is illustrated with a proof-of-concept case study between two semantic-aware cyber-physical machine tools. The semantic communication provided by the SCPS architecture makes ubiquitous M2M communication in a network of manufacturing devices environment possible, laying the foundation for collaborative manufacturing automation for achieving smart manufacturing. Another case study focusing on decentralized production control between machines in a workshop also proved the merits of semantic-aware M2M communication technologies. © 2020 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers","tags":[],"title":"Semantic communications between distributed cyber-physical systems towards collaborative automation for smart manufacturing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yuqian Lu","X.

The fundamental issue of on-demand manufacturing service provision is service composition, where distributed manufacturing resources are mapped to personalised service requests. This paper examines knowledge-based service composition and adaptive resource planning in a cloud manufacturing environment. The intention is to develop an integrated networked environment, allowing fast resource allocation for a given service request, subject to governance policies, resource access policies, resource availability information and etcetera. The research challenge in this is to explore a feasible service composition method that facilitates easy mapping between service requests and manufacturing resources based on restrictive rule sets in the cloud and availability information about a resource.

Thus, an accurate and prompt analysis of customer requirements (CRs) in the early design stage is critical to its success. However, most OKP companies are small or medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Due to the limited resources and low product planning budget, they often cannot obtain abundant CR information nor can they afford the expense of complicated planning process. To address these issues, a system framework is proposed in support of OKP product planning process in a cloud-based design (CBD) environment. The challenges and future market niches of OKP companies are presented. The comparison of typical distributed systems shows that CBD, which utilizes advanced information technologies and business model, has advantages in providing sufficient resources, decreasing product development time span for OKP companies in a cost-efficient way. This article describes the proposed system architecture, the business interaction process and the information communication among customers, designers and marketing analysts at the product planning stage. To validate the proposed framework, a prototype system module MyProduct is under development in the CBD environment with an illustrative example. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","tags":[],"title":"A system framework for OKP product planning in a cloud-based design environment","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yuqian Lu","T.

As manufacturing activities become increasingly distributed while connected in the new era of manufacturing -Industry 4.0, energy-efficient manufacturing (E2M) strategies and methodologies should be implemented in a global production network, especially in an Industry 4.0 environment. The research work reported in this paper attempts to develop a feasible solution to implementing energy-efficient manufacturing in such an environment by proposing a technical framework, integrated with the developed platform, MCloud, to facilitate energy-efficient production. The overall technical framework is discussed in detail, particularly, the proposed E2M module and two-round communication procedure. Feature-based technology was adopted in process planning to assess technical capability and energy-consumption of connected cyber-physical systems. MCloud allows the connected cyber-physical systems to use local energy consumption models for energy assessment. A case study was presented for collaboratively perform a manufacturing job, proving that the enhanced MCloud can organize customized production activities based on energy-saving needs in an Industry 4.0 environment.","tags":[],"title":"Cyber-physical production network for energy-efficient manufacturing: A framework","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"We have developed a fully-functional cloud manufacturing environment targeting efficient production of highly personalised products.\nThe live system is available for evaluation at: https://mcloud.foe.auckland.ac.nz.

This paper discusses the requirements of CAPP systems in a cloud environment and proposes a feasible system framework for next-generation CAPP systems. The proposed system is built upon Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) architecture, which enables smooth system integration among different manufacturers.

A handful of cloud manufacturing systems are proposed for different business scenarios, most of which fall into one of three deployment modes, i.e. private cloud, community cloud, and public cloud. One of the challenges in the existing solutions is that few of them are capable of adapting to changes in the business environment. In fact, different companies may have different cloud requirements in different business situations; even a company at different business stages may need different cloud modes. Nevertheless, there is limited support on migrating to different cloud modes in existing solutions. This paper proposes a Hybrid Manufacturing Cloud that allows companies to deploy different cloud modes for their periodic business goals. Three typical cloud modes, i.e. private cloud, community cloud and public cloud are supported in the system. Furthermore, it enables companies to set self-defined access rules for each resource so that unauthorised companies will not have access to the resource. This self-managed mechanism gives companies full control of their businesses and boosts their trust with enhanced privacy protection. A unified ontology is developed to enhance semantic interoperability throughout the whole process of service provision in the clouds. A Cloud Management Engine is developed to manage all the user-defined clouds, in which Semantic Web technologies are used as the main toolkit. The feasibility of this approach is verified through a group of companies, each of which has complex access requirements for their resources. In addition, a use case is carried out between customers and service providers. This way, optimal service is delivered through the proposed system. © 2014 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers.","tags":[],"title":"Development of a Hybrid Manufacturing Cloud","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yuqian Lu","Q.

Enterprises involved in cloud manufacturing networks share their heterogeneous business models, manufacturing resources and knowledge to provide high quality consumable manufacturing services. Therefore, there is a need to develop a resource description protocol and service description language to cover all the aspects of cloud-based business collaborations in manufacturing industry. This information model needs to be inclusive of representation of all phases of a product's lifecycle, service model description, and other essential information contributed to e-businesses. This paper presents an ontology-based approach to enable sematic interoperability throughout the whole process of service provision in the clouds. The detailed requirements for enabling cloud-based data exchange are discussed. A generic ontology development process is then proposed with special focus on reusing existing international and/or industrial standards. Specifically highlighted is a systematic guidance on developing ontologies. The utilisation of the proposed ontology in resource virtualisation and resource retrieval in cloud manufacturing environments is also elaborated.
