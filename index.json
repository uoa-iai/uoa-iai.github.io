Dr. Hashemi-Petroodi is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Operations Management and Information Systems. He received his Ph.D. in Industrial Engineering and Operations Research from IMT Atlantique, France, and has led key tasks in major European projects such as ASSISTANT. His research focuses on combinatorial and robust optimization, reconfigurable assembly line design, workforce and process planning, and decision support systems.\nDuring the talk, Dr. Hashemi-Petroodi introduced KEDGE Business School and its research activities, including the EU Horizon MODALSHIFT project on multimodal transport systems and dynamic decision-making. He then presented his recent work on robust design and reconfiguration planning of mixed-model assembly lines under product evolution and demand uncertainty.\nThe first study explored how to robustly react to product family evolution in production design and reconfiguration. A novel robust Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model combined with an adversarial approach was shown to significantly reduce long-term costs compared with classical periodic approaches. The second study addressed the robust re-balancing of assembly lines facing random product sequences, modeling worker movements and dynamic task re-allocation as a Markov Decision Process integrated with MILP. Computational experiments demonstrated the efficiency of the proposed models and the superiority of dynamic over fixed task assignments.\nThe session concluded with an active discussion among Dr. Hashemi-Petroodi, Dr. Yuqian Lu, and students on the challenges of uncertainty in assembly systems and the potential of reinforcement learning for future human-robot collaborative environments.\n","date":1758844800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1758844800,"objectID":"03c403c11467954fbdee474127296c93","permalink":"https://uoa-iai.github.io/post/seminar-seyyed/","publishdate":"2025-09-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/seminar-seyyed/","section":"post","summary":"Delighted to have Dr. Seyyed Ehsan Hashemi-Petroodi share his inspiring insights on robust optimization and assembly line reconfiguration.","tags":["Seminar","Robust Optimization","Assembly Line Reconfiguration"],"title":"Seminar- Dr. Seyyed Ehsan Hashemi-Petroodi","type":"post"},{"authors":["admin"],"categories":["publication"],"content":"Embodied Intelligence Empowering Smart Manufacturing Submission deadline: 31 August 2025 Embodied Intelligence (EI) is a key enabler of flexible and efficient manufacturing in smart manufacturing. EI enhances the perception, memory, cognition, reasoning, decision-making, planning, control, and iterative evolution capabilities within smart manufacturing systems. However, existing AI methods designed for specific tasks may lack adaptability and learning evolution capabilities needed to address personalization. The limited knowledge sharing and collaboration among independent AI models result hinders collective intelligence. AI methods that rely on fixed models and predefined rules are not easily adaptable to unpredictable scenarios in flexible, dynamic, and unstructured manufacturing environments. In addition, human-machine collaboration in smart manufacturing remains inefficient, and manufacturing equipment demands more intelligent collaborative control methods. The standalone equipment and information exchange in current smart manufacturing systems do not fully support the implementation of embodied intelligence technologies. To elevate the intelligence of smart manufacturing, this special issue aims at exploring technological advancements and applications of embodied intelligence-driven smart manufacturing. It will address key technical challenges in areas such as multimodal fusion, machine learning algorithms, human-computer interaction, and collaboration.

Lu just won a Best Paper Award at the recently concluded 51st International Conference on Computers and Industrial Engineering (CIE51), 9-11 December 2024, at UNSW Sydney, Australia, for his paper ‘Instructing Collaborative Robots using Large Language Models for Human-Robot Collaboration’. Ilango Kandasamy has recently completed his Master of Robotics \u0026amp; Automation Engineering programme.\nBelow is the abstract of the paper:\n“The future of smart manufacturing hinges on robots enhancing performance and productivity, but the complex communication interface between humans and robots remains a challenge. Using natural language instructions to guide robots during collaboration will significantly improve human-robot interaction. Despite the efforts to improve the robot’s ability to interpret natural language instructions, progress has been limited due to the weak generalisation and adaptability of traditional robot programming methods. Pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) trained on huge volumes of text data excel in Natural Language processing tasks such as semantic parsing and automatic text generation. In this study, we explored using LLMs to comprehend the basic industrial assembly instructions in natural language and convert them into low-level tasks for robots to execute additional training. We used the assembly instructions from the HA-ViD dataset to evaluate the performance of GPT-3.5 model in semantic parsing of these instructions. The GPT-3.5 demonstrated excellent generalisation in converting previously unseen industrial assembly instructions by learning from prompts. Additionally, we explored the possibility of using Vision Language Models (VLM) for object detection tasks in a novel scenario by prompting them with text input to specify target objects to be detected in the image. Finally, we proposed an end-to-end system architecture to illustrate the integration of voice and LLMs, demonstrating the performance of GPT-3.5 in converting natural language instruction into low-level robot actions for industrial assembly tasks.”\n","date":1734480000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1734480000,"objectID":"48c4feba7bd3580fa10c7d319856a140","permalink":"https://uoa-iai.github.io/post/cie-best-paper/","publishdate":"2024-12-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/cie-best-paper/","section":"post","summary":"We are delighted to share that Ilango Kandasamy and Yuqian Lu just won a Best Paper Award at the recently concluded 51st International Conference on Computers and Industrial Engineering (CIE51), 9-11 December 2024, at UNSW Sydney, Australia, for their paper 'Instructing Collaborative Robots using Large Language Models for Human-Robot Collaboration'.

Multimodal human-robot communication interfaces will ensure accessibility and cultural relevance, including support for te reo Māori.\nThe team comprises experts in human sensing, robot control, human-machine interactions, and Māori knowledge, ensuring a comprehensive approach. We will collaborate closely with stakeholders throughout the project, including government agencies, industry associations, end-users, consultants, and Māori and Pacific communities. By co-designing the technology with key industry partners, we will ensure its effectiveness and commercial viability. Ultimately, the project seeks to revolutionise manufacturing automation in New Zealand and globally, leading to improved productivity, product quality, and economic benefits. The advanced robot control technologies will also have global applications and can be exported as high-value software packages.

Original post at https://www.sftichallenge.govt.nz/blending-cutting-edge-science-and-commercial-potential/ SfTI-sponsored researcher collaborates with telecoms giants For many scientists, success is measured in the number of high-impact papers they publish. For others, it is about training the next generation of innovators. For some, the focus is on commercialisation – translating their research into real-world products. Dr Yuqian Lu from the University of Auckland (UoA) is a scientist achieving all three, with the support of SfTI.\nCurrently a Senior Lecturer in the Faculty of Engineering, Yuqian also leads the university’s Industrial AI Group. There, he and his team work on everything from human-robot collaboration to next-generation communication for manufacturing systems. “We really believe artificial intelligence and robotics can have a huge impact on industry,” he says. “Our work is about transforming the workplace into a more efficient, enjoyable, and sustainable environment.”\n“We really believe artificial intelligence and robotics can have a huge impact on industry,” he says. “Our work is about transforming the workplace into a more efficient, enjoyable, and sustainable environment.”\nThis ambitious vision has been developing ever since Yuqian moved to New Zealand to do his PhD in mechatronics at UoA. While working on his thesis, Yuqian found himself considering his next steps. “The obvious choice was to go into a postdoc. But my research area was very industry-facing, and I wanted to make a long-term impact in those areas. I felt nervous that I had no real understanding of how industry works, or how they identify what’s important to them. So, I chose to start my career in industry.” He would end up spending three-and-a-half years away from the lab, working on manufacturing process automation and intelligent system R\u0026amp;D for NZ-based companies. In his most senior role, Yuqian acted as product owner for a series of new commercial software products at FRAMECAD Ltd. “It was like a start-up experience within a big company,” he explains. “I did everything from leading the R\u0026amp;D, to developing the market strategy and pricing models.”\nThat experience would stay with Yuqian, and since returning to academia in 2019, it has shaped the way he approaches research. “I always ask myself and my students, what’s the biggest impact we can have? Regardless of whether they’re doing a masters or a PhD, I want them to work on something that will ultimately be transformative to that specific industry. We consider the whole commercial pathway.” His entrepreneurial approach to science has attracted attention from funding bodies and commercial companies alike.\n“I always ask myself and my students, what’s the biggest impact we can have? Regardless of whether they’re doing a masters or a PhD, I want them to work on something that will ultimately be transformative to that specific industry. We consider the whole commercial pathway.”\nIn 2021, Yuqian received a seed grant from SfTI. Titled ‘Ultra-reliable time-sensitive industrial control in the cloud’, his project aims to combine three cutting-edge technologies – automation, artificial intelligence, and 5G communication – to improve robotic control in industrial settings. He’s collaborating with telecoms experts at Spark and Nokia, and computer scientists at Victoria University of Wellington, to make this a reality.\nToday, industrial robots communicate via wired connections between a local controller and the robot body. This reduces the time it takes to transmit and receive data, ensuring that a robot arm does exactly what its instructed to, at precisely the right moment. However, if this communication could instead happen in the cloud wirelessly, it could offer incredible opportunities, as Yuqian explains. “Imagine if one day, we could have the world’s top surgeon based in the US remotely operating on a patient in Auckland Hospital via robots. Or a fleet of industrial robots are centrally managed remotely” Our current 4G network doesn’t allow for sufficiently fast and reliable data exchange, so Yuqian is looking ahead to 5G. “The critical piece of the SfTI research is to develop smart algorithms that can compensate for issues that may occur even during 5G data transmission? So that, from an application perspective, a robot can move smoothly, in a time-sensitive way.”\n“Imagine if one day, we could have the world’s top surgeon based in the US remotely operating on a patient in Auckland Hospital via robots. Or a fleet of industrial robots are centrally managed remotely”\nJoseph Wong, Innovation Lead of Spark New Zealand says, “We are proud to work with Yuqian on this particular project. Spark’s goal is to help New Zealanders win big in a digital world, and Yuqian’s project certainly fits very well into that. The research is very valuable – it basically opens up cloud-based robotics control to …","date":1722470400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1722470400,"objectID":"64f287b7ead098c14e9a292060510437","permalink":"https://uoa-iai.github.io/post/sfti-interview/","publishdate":"2024-08-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/sfti-interview/","section":"post","summary":"Dr. Yuqian Lu is blending cutting-edge science with commercial potential.

Titled ‘Ultra-reliable time-sensitive industrial control in the cloud’, his project aims to combine three cutting-edge technologies – automation, artificial intelligence, and 5G communication – to improve robotic control in industrial settings. And he’s collaborating with telecoms experts at Spark and Nokia, and computer scientists at Victoria University of Wellington to make this a reality. Today, the communication networks that connect industrial robots are via wired connections between a local controller and the robot body. This reduces the time it takes to transmit and receive data, ensuring that a robot arm does exactly what its instructed to, at precisely the right moment. However, if this communication could instead happen in the cloud wirelessly, it could offer incredible opportunities, as Yuqian explains. “Imagine if one day, we could have the world’s top surgeon based in the US remotely operating on a patient in Auckland Hospital via robots. Or a fleet of industrial robots are centrally managed remotely” Our current 4G network doesn’t allow for sufficiently fast and reliable data exchange, so Yuqian is looking ahead to 5G. “The critical piece of the SfTI research is to develop smart algorithms that can compensate for issues that may occur even during 5G data transmission? So that, from an application perspective, a robot can move smoothly, in a time-sensitive way.”\nFor further details, please check below additional media coverage:\nBig potential for future of industrial robotics Can 5G deliver real-time cloud control for industrial robots?

The production line is a complex manufacturing system with a complex structure. There are multidisciplinary correlation networks between different design dimensions, such as causality, mapping, and transfer. Clarifying these correlative relations is the key to the design of production line correlation. In this paper, a descriptive system is built for the production line configuration model, the motion model, the control model, and the optimization model, and the design content of production lines is clarified. A design framework of production line correlation based on the digital twin technology is proposed, and an optimization system of design schemes is built in the form of hierarchical iteration.

This setting enables the utilization of both humans’ and robots’ skills and assets to create flexible manufacturing systems capable of producing high variability products. However, poor integration between humans and robots can lead to lower productivity and higher worker stress unless human wellness is constantly monitored and optimized. This research aims to advance the current theories of Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC) to maximize manufacturing productivity and human wellness by defining, monitoring, and optimizing human fatigue levels during dynamic human-robot task allocation. New methods will be developed to optimize human wellness and manage contingencies by allocating resources based on real-time task progress and human fatigue levels. This research’s success will lead to a greater understanding of collaborative work cells in unstructured manufacturing settings.\nPublications\nYuqian Lu, Juvenal Sastre Adrados, Saahil Shivneel Chand, Lihui Wang (2021).

Manufacturers aspire to a shift towards mass personalization – a paradigm that produces personalized products at mass efficiency. In mass personalization, traditional manufacturing automation technologies designed for mass customization, such as product family architecture, reconfiguration manufacturing systems and delayed differentiation, will fail if not adapt as batch size becomes one and manufacturing is dynamically driven by unique customer needs. Hence, smart manufacturing system was devised to represent a new generation of manufacturing system that can dynamically configure the manufacturing processes and systems to carry out optimized production of unique products based on near real-time environment sensing, humanoid reasoning and reconfiguration of system models. At the core, smart manufacturing systems need perceptive and decisive capabilities, leading to dynamic self-organizing behaviors. With advanced cognitive capabilities, manufacturing equipment, systems, and factories can self-sense, self-communicate, self-reason, and self-configure to prevent potential critical issues, optimize operations, and enhance the overall integration of machines, humans, and digital supply networks.\nPublications\nDazzle Johnson, Gang Chen, Yuqian Lu (2022).

It might not be something out of a science-fiction novel too much longer.\nDr Yuqian Lu from the Department of Mechanical Engineering is creating a mobile robot that can do just that. The robot has built-in intelligence to navigate around people and obstacles, think and act autonomously. Lu wants to create a robot that can work alongside humans as part of a human-robot team to meet New Zealand’s industry needs better.\nTraditional automation techniques are efficient for creating standardised products at large volume: cars, phones, and more. But that doesn’t work for lots of New Zealand manufacturers. Many New Zealand manufacturers are smaller than their overseas counterparts and make highly customised products with manual or semi-automated manufacturing processes. “You may be surprised to see the amount of manual and repetitive work in the factories of some of the most innovative high-tech companies”, Dr Lu says.\nIt’s generally not technically or commercially viable for these manufacturers to invest in expensive standardised automation technologies. So, Dr Lu, with his colleagues from the Laboratory of Industry 4.0 Smart Manufacturing Lab at the Faculty of Engineering, proposed a solution. What if they built a flexible and intelligent robot that could help with many different jobs and move from project to project?\nFor this reason, an autonomous mobile robot allows manufacturers an unprecedented level of flexibility. It can be integrated with already-existing manufacturing cells to co-manipulate manual work. New Zealand small manufacturers can introduce flexible robots gradually, test them out, and take their own steps towards automating their facilities. Dr Lu is also working on teaching his robots to autonomously learn new tasks in a factory to better support human operators.\nDr Lu’s goal is that the mobile robot will soon work as an assistant or as part of a team with human workers. He envisions it helping screw things in and working safely around human operators to free them of tedious and repetitive work, among other tasks. “We want to create a human-robot collaboration,” Dr Lu said.\n","date":1648080000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1648080000,"objectID":"5c8fc5ce67ddaab3b2ead64af689c655","permalink":"https://uoa-iai.github.io/post/mobile-manipulator/","publishdate":"2022-03-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/mobile-manipulator/","section":"post","summary":"Interview by University of Auckland on our lastest mobile manipulator development.","tags":["robot","computer vision"],"title":"A mobile manipulator to help workers on the factory floor","type":"post"},{"authors":["admin"],"categories":["Publication","Award"],"content":"The Best Paper is awarded each year to the RCIM paper published in the past seven-year with the highest number of citations measured in Scopus over the past five years.

time-sensitive industrial control in the cloud\nPublic Statement: As the momentum of 5G builds, a range of applications will be developed. These include real-time cloud-controlled industrial systems and self-driving vehicles. The need is for 5G technology to provide robust and time-sensitive data transmission over wide area networks (WANs). This is to ensure the systems and vehicles can interact simultaneously without, for example, arriving out of order or colliding. This project, led by University of Auckland researchers, aims to design a data communication scheduling algorithm and supporting streaming technologies. This will enable time-sensitive transmission of control data for multiple devices over WANs.\n","date":1634601600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1634601600,"objectID":"fe070ba72b2b33cf44be4838ed537489","permalink":"https://uoa-iai.github.io/post/sfti/","publishdate":"2021-10-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/sfti/","section":"post","summary":"Industrial AI Team @ UOA was awarded the prestigious SfTI seed grants to advance time-sensitive industrial control technologies in 5G environment, in collaboration with Victoria University of Wellington, Spark New Zealand and Nokia.","tags":["5G","control","grant"],"title":"2021 Science for Technological Innovation National Science Challenge (SfTI) Grant","type":"post"},{"authors":["Qibing Lv","Rong Zhang","Xuemin Sun","Yuqian Lu","Jinsong Bao"],"categories":null,"content":"Add the full text or supplementary notes for the publication here using Markdown formatting.\n","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609459200,"objectID":"8512fb4d40b6294f7034f3f4a3cc26d5","permalink":"https://uoa-iai.github.io/publication/lv-2021837/","publishdate":"2026-02-27T09:37:37.041026Z","relpermalink":"/publication/lv-2021837/","section":"publication","summary":"Add the full text or supplementary notes for the publication here using Markdown formatting.","tags":[],"title":"A digital twin-driven human-robot collaborative assembly approach in the wake of COVID-19","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Liang Guo","Ming Zhou","Yuqian Lu","Tao Yang","Fan Yang"],"categories":null,"content":"Add the full text or supplementary notes for the publication here using Markdown formatting.\n","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609459200,"objectID":"0dc718785336d3985ed8a8890c76e7c5","permalink":"https://uoa-iai.github.io/publication/guo-2021257/","publishdate":"2026-02-27T09:37:37.037627Z","relpermalink":"/publication/guo-2021257/","section":"publication","summary":"Add the full text or supplementary notes for the publication here using Markdown formatting.","tags":[],"title":"A hybrid 3D feature recognition method based on rule and graph","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shimin Liu","Xuemin Sun","Yuqian Lu","Baicun Wang","Jinsong Bao","Guoqiang Guo"],"categories":null,"content":"Add the full text or supplementary notes for the publication here using Markdown formatting.\n","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609459200,"objectID":"2ddf8ad9349581aa90cc3c9867bd0353","permalink":"https://uoa-iai.github.io/publication/liu-2021182/","publishdate":"2026-02-27T09:37:37.148994Z","relpermalink":"/publication/liu-2021182/","section":"publication","summary":"Add the full text or supplementary notes for the publication here using Markdown formatting.","tags":[],"title":"A Knowledge-Driven Digital Twin Modeling Method for Machining Products Based on Biomimicry;
