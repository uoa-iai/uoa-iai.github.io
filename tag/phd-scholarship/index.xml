      <title>We are hiring - full PhD scholarships and post-doc position on human-robot collaboration (MBIE Endeavour Fund)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We are excited that the IAI Research Group has been awarded $1 million over 3 years from Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) Endeavour Fund to work on “Ultra-flexible human-robot collaborative product assembly”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The manufacturing industry in Aotearoa New Zealand faces a longstanding productivity challenge due to the unsuitability of traditional automation methods for its high-mix-low-volume nature. To address this, we will develop ultra-flexible smooth human-robot collaboration technologies. These innovations will enable seamless interaction between humans and robots in dynamic manufacturing setups, particularly in product assembly, through advanced cognitive capabilities. Robots equipped with real-time human state sensing, reasoning, and adaptive behaviour planning will understand and respond to human physical and cognitive states, enhancing productivity. Multimodal human-robot communication interfaces will ensure accessibility and cultural relevance, including support for te reo Māori.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team comprises experts in human sensing, robot control, human-machine interactions, and Māori knowledge, ensuring a comprehensive approach. We will collaborate closely with stakeholders throughout the project, including government agencies, industry associations, end-users, consultants, and Māori and Pacific communities. By co-designing the technology with key industry partners, we will ensure its effectiveness and commercial viability. Ultimately, the project seeks to revolutionise manufacturing automation in New Zealand and globally, leading to improved productivity, product quality, and economic benefits. The advanced robot control technologies will also have global applications and can be exported as high-value software packages. Importantly, the project incorporates Tikanga following Māori data sovereignty principles and aims to support workplace well-being for Māori and all New Zealanders, emphasising cultural sensitivity and inclusivity in technology development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Two PhD Scholarships and One Postdoc Research Fellow Position Available&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are looking for two full scholarship PhD students and one post-doc researcher to join us. Please check the job descriptions for information on project details, candidate requirements and application processes: &lt;a href=&#34;https://uoa-iai.github.io/uploads/2024mbiejobs.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Job Details&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Application Deadline: &lt;strong&gt;1st November 2024&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For further information, feel free to contact: Dr. Yuqian Lu (&lt;a href=&#34;mailto:yuqian.lu@auckland.ac.nz&#34;&gt;yuqian.lu@auckland.ac.nz&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
